📁 Dataset Not Included in Repository

Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the original Spotify dataset files (`artists.csv` and `tracks.csv`) are not included here.

You can download the full dataset directly from Kaggle:

🔗 Kaggle Dataset URL:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nimishasen27/spotify-dataset?resource=download

Once downloaded, place the following files into the `data/` folder:
- artists.csv
- tracks.csv

This will enable you to open and explore the Power BI report (`SpotifyDashboard.pbix`) fully with all visuals working.

If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out or open an issue on this repo. Happy analyzing! 🎧📊
