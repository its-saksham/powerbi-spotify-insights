# 🎧 Spotify Dataset Not Included

Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the original dataset files (`artists.csv` and `tracks.csv`) are **not included** in this repository.

---

## 📥 How to Get the Dataset

You can download the full dataset from Kaggle here:

🔗 **[Spotify Dataset 1921–2020 (160k+ Tracks) – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nimishasen27/spotify-dataset?resource=download)**

---

## 📁 Required Files

After downloading, place the following files into the `/data` folder:

- `artists.csv`
- `tracks.csv`

This will allow the Power BI report (`SpotifyDashboard.pbix`) to function fully with all visuals and insights working.

## ❓ Need Help?

If you're unsure how to structure the folders or load the files, check the main [README](../README.md) or open an issue on this repo.

Happy analyzing! 🎶
